# Sort Movies
Places folders within separate folders based on whether they already have a subtitle file (`.srt`). Use [vlsub](https://github.com/exebetche/vlsub) (add-on for VLC) in the `_NO_SUBS_` folder to quickly fetch their subtitles from [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.org/).

## Folders
- `_PLACE_MOVIES_HERE_` - Place your movie folders inside here.
- `_WITH_SUBS_` - Output folder of movies with subtitles
- `_NO_SUBS_` - Output folder of movies without subtitles
